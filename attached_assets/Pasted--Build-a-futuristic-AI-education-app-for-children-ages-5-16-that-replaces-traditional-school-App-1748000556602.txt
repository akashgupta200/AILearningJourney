 Build a futuristic AI education app for children (ages 5–16) that replaces traditional school.

App Name (Optional): EduVerse – The AI Tutor Universe
Goal:
Create a cross-platform mobile and web app that provides a complete school-like education through AI-generated real video simulations of human-like tutors, personalized learning paths, and immersive learning environments in multiple languages.

🎯 Core Features:
Hyper-Realistic AI Tutors:

Generate AI avatars that look and behave like real tutors (video simulation).

Tutors should speak naturally, lip-synced, and with facial expressions.

Dynamic interactions: Tutors answer questions in real-time using AI (e.g., GPT-4.5).

AI-driven progress tracking and adaptive curriculum per student.

Learning adjusts based on student’s pace, mood, strengths, and challenges.

Daily/weekly goals and revision plans automatically generated.

Immersive AR/VR Modules:

Use AR or VR to simulate concepts (e.g., human anatomy walk-through, planetary exploration).

Compatible with standard mobile AR and optional VR headsets (e.g., Meta Quest).

Gamified Experience:

XP points, level-ups, badges, achievements.

Leaderboards and friendly classroom competitions.

“Daily Quests” and “Brain Challenges.”

Virtual School World:

Interactive dashboard with rooms: classroom, science lab, library, playground.

Customizable avatar and digital backpack.

Group tasks with other kids or AI classmates.

On-Demand Help & Feedback:
